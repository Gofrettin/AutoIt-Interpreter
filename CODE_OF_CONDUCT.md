# Code of Conduct - Unknown6656 Style

## Our Standards

We have none. Be as spicy as you want to be.<br/>
Like I'd give a fâ–ˆck.

## Our Code Standards

 - Allman style.
 - You can remove `{` and `}` around single-lined blocks, e.g.:
    ```csharp
    if (true)
        func();

    do
        func();
    while (true);
    ```
    But do **not** write any of this crap:
    ```csharp
    if (true) func();
    
    do func(); while (true);
    ```
 - `PascalCase` for types, methods, properties, public identifiers, etc.
 - `underscore_lower_case` for method parameters and local variables
 - `_underscore_lower_case` for private fields
 - `CAPS_LOCK_CASE` for constants
 
**To avoid any association with slavery, the `master`-branch has been renamed to `daddy` :wink:.**

## Our Responsibilities

LMAO Bottom Text

## Enforcement

If you want to be a dick, that's fine by me. I might also be one - but that's to be expected.
