# A rough AutoIt3 custom-flavored syntax reference
[go back](../readme.md)

The AutoIt3-syntax is fully compatible with the AutoIt++ dialect, meaning that the [official syntax reference](https://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/docs/) applies to AutoIt++.
<br/>
This article, however, attempts to display a complete syntax tree of the AutoIt++ dialect.
<br/>
If a 'more human readable' and more visually descriptive list of AutoIt++ syntax feautures is requested, please refer to the [AutoIt++ syntax reference](syntax.md)
